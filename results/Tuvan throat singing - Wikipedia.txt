Tuvan throat singing, Khoomei, Hooliin Chor (in Mongolian, ‘throat harmony’), or Mongolian throat singing  is one particular variant of overtone singing practiced by people in Mongolia, Inner Mongolia, Tuva and Siberia.
In 2009, it was inscribed on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity of UNESCO, under the name Mongolian art of singing, Khoomei.
In Mongolian throat singing, the performer produces a fundamental pitch and—simultaneously—one or more pitches over that.
The history of Mongolian throat singing reaches far back.
Many male herders can throat sing, but women are beginning to practice the technique as well.
The popularity of throat singing among Mongolians seems to have arisen as a result of geographic location and culture.
The open landscape of Mongolia allows for the sounds to carry a great distance.
Ethnomusicologists studying throat singing in these areas mark khoomei as an integral part in the ancient pastoral animism that is still practiced today.
Often, singers travel far into the countryside looking for the right river, or go up to the steppes of the mountainside to create the proper environment for throat-singing.
The animistic world view of this region identifies the spirituality of objects in nature, not just in their shape or location, but in their sound as well.
