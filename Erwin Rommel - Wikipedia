Johannes Erwin Eugen Rommel (15 November 1891 – 14 October 1944) was a German general and military theorist.
Popularly known as the Desert Fox, he served as field marshal in the Wehrmacht (Defense Force) of Nazi Germany during World War II, as well as serving in the Reichswehr of the Weimar Republic, and the army of Imperial Germany.
Rommel was a highly decorated officer in World War I and was awarded the Pour le Mérite for his actions on the Italian Front.
In 1937 he published his classic book on military tactics, Infantry Attacks, drawing on his experiences from World War I.
In World War II, he distinguished himself as the commander of the 7th Panzer Division during the 1940 invasion of France.
His leadership of German and Italian forces in the North African Campaign established his reputation as one of the most able tank commanders of the war, and earned him the nickname der Wüstenfuchs, "the Desert Fox".
Among his British adversaries he earned a strong reputation for chivalry, and the North African campaign has often been called a "war without hate".
He later commanded the German forces opposing the Allied cross-channel invasion of Normandy in June 1944.
Rommel supported the Nazi seizure of power and Adolf Hitler, although his reluctant stance towards antisemitism, Nazi ideology and level of knowledge of the Holocaust remain a matter of debate among scholars.
In 1944, Rommel was implicated in the 20 July plot to assassinate Hitler.
